### A beautiful and easy to use UI for NFT creators.

An easy all-in-one platform for founders without technical skills to create their NFT community, while allowing members to freely customize their personal NFT.

PIXELATE is Free and Open Source. It written using Notus React, tailwindCSS and Solidity. The Solidity contract automatically mints the art on the Polygon MATIC blockchain and deploys it to the Openseas account linked to the MetaMask wallet used by the user. This makes it a breeze for anyone to setup a NFT.
